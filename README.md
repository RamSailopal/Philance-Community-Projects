The company, Philance, Inc. is a Benefit Corporation incorporated in Massachusetts, USA. This is a for-profit social enterprise because we did not want to rely on donations to bring our vision to reality. Even though it is a for-profit enterprise, the software platform is open-source so anyone can contribute, modify, redistribute and use it. This is in line with the guiding principle of the company, which is to be of benefit to the public good.

To get started with the development process, please look at [this Wiki page](https://github.com/Philance/Philance/wiki/Isolated-Development-Environment-Setup) first on how to setup a local development environment on your machine and clone the Philance repo to it.
